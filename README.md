### Algorithm
This project contains the supporting material of the paper entitled "Applying MILP Method to Search Integral Distinguishers Based on Division Property for 6 Lightweight Block Ciphers", which has been accepted by Asiacrypt 2016.

The project implements the three algorithms presented in the paper.

- Algorithm 1 is implemented in C++. 
- Algorithm 2 is implemented in Python.
- Algorithm 3 is implemented in Python with the help of Gurobi optimizer. How to use Gurobi in Python can be found here: http://www.gurobi.com/
